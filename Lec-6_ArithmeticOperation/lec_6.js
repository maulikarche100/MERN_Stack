//Arithmetic Operators
// Arithmetic means calculations in maths this very important part in JS

//Sum of two numbers
//ex

let a = 20;
let b = 30;
console.log(a+b);

let c = 20;
let d = 30;
let e = a+b;
console.log("Sum of two numbers=",a+b);

//Subtraction of two numbers 
//ex

let x = 40;
let y = 30;
console.log("subtraction of two number is ", x-y);

//Multiplication of two numbers 
// ex 

let f = 390;
let g = 28;
console.log("Multiplication of two numbers =",+ f*g);


//Division of two Numbers

//ex

let h = 45;
let i = 2;
console.log("Division of two numbers = ", + h/i);

//Power of a number(2^3 = 8)

//ex

let j = 9**3;
console.log("power of the number =", j);


//Remainder of Number(%);
//ex

let k = 40;
let l = 20;
console.log("Remainder of the given number =", k % l);


//weird behavior of of arithmetic operators
//ex

const num = 123;
const str = "abc";
result = num * 2;
console.log(result);
result = str * 2;
console.log(result);// output: NaN(Not a Number)
