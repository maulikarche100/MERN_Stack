//Sum of two numbers
//ex

let a = 20;
let b = 30;
console.log(a+b);

let c = 20;
let d = 30;
let e = a+b;
console.log("Sum of two numbers=",a+b);

//Subtraction of two numbers 
//ex

let x = 40;
let y = 30;
console.log("subtraction of two number is ", x-y);

//Multiplication of two numbers 
// ex 

let f = 390;
let g = 28;
console.log("Multiplication of two numbers =",+ f*g);


//Division of two Numbers

let h = 45;
let i = 2;
